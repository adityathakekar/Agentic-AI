        "## 📖 Overview\n",
        "VC Analyst Swarm is a multi-agent system designed to automate the initial phase of Venture Capital research. Instead of a single AI hallucinating facts, this system employs three distinct agents in a pipeline:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **The Researcher:** Scours the web for real-time market data.\n",
        "2. **The Skeptic:** A specialized agent that \"stress tests\" the data to find risks.\n",
        "3. **The Editor:** Synthesizes the conflict into a balanced Investment Memo.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🏗️ Architecture\n",
        "The system uses a **Sequential Handoff Pattern**:\n",
        "`[User Input] -> [Researcher Agent + Tool Use] -> [Skeptic Agent] -> [Editor Agent] -> [Markdown Report]`\n",
        "\n",
        "Built with **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash** for low latency and high reasoning capabilities.\n",
        "\n",

        "1. Clone the repository.\n",
        "2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",

        "\n",
        "### 2. The Tool Layer (`src/tools.py`)\n",
        "A modular wrapper around `DuckDuckGoSearch`. The agents are trained to emit a special token `[SEARCH: query]` which the system intercepts, executes, and feeds back into the prompt.\n",

        "### 3. The Cognitive Layer (Gemini 1.5)\n",
